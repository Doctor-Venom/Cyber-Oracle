the agent collects 4 types of information about the host:
1.general activity information (not important but can be useful when investigating incidents)
2.user information (information about the user and the groups he is part of)
3.system information (information about the system and its components/apps/services/files and policies and settings)
4.neighborhood information (information about neighboring devices on all connected networks)

this information is structured in JSON format and encrypted then sent to the central monitor
